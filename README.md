# Gr√ºn auf, Kumpel*in

This project is set up for the Hackathon in Residence at Biennale 2022 of lala.ruhr ([see the call](https://www.lala.ruhr/2022/06/30/call-hackathon-in-residence/)).
We build a VR-experience where people are able to step into a virtual environment dosplaying their current position on a paved yard. FOr the VR another person is able to active different weather conditions and different szenarios. These could be changed from a tablet (Samsung Galaxy Tab A8, for wich the UI was optimized) that was located next to the person with the VR glasses on. You can find the UI for the tablet as the index page. The gallery page is shown at [gruenaufkumpelin.de](https://gruenaufkumpelin.de). People inside the VR can take photos that are uploaded to the gallery with additional information about the current setting and here you can comment and see how the conditions could have an effect on the local climate. The project was focusing on sustainable, participatory urban development.
